# My First Python Project

This is a beginner-level Python project I created to practice the basics of:
- Variables
- Data Types (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`)
- Type Casting (`str()`)

The project is a simple "profile" that prints out some personal information, such as name, age, hobby, height, and student status.

## What I Learned
- How to store information in variables
- How to use different data types: strings, integers, floats, and booleans
- How to convert data types (e.g., `int` to `str`) to display them with `print()`
- How to format my code with line breaks for readability
